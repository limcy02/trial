Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (p < 0.05) and visualised via heat map and volcano plot. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and pathway enrichment analysis were then performed to evaluate the biological pathways affected by significant genes.

One of the top DEGs from the volcano plot, COL8A2, is displayed in this cluster. The TGFB2 gene (padj = 0.015) is involved in several enriched pathways, as shown by its multiple nodal connections, suggesting a pleiotropic effect and a vital role in cell adhesion processes. Therefore, further investigation of this gene is recommended.

                        The top DEGs in this dataset include CCK, THRB, MYO3A, CRISPLD2, COL8A2, and LAMC2, with COL8A2 being the only one involved in an enriched pathway. The enriched biological pathways include upregulated pathways related to cell adhesion and downregulated pathways related to chromatin structure, both of which are consistent with associations found in current schizophrenia research.
